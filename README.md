# Super Ultra Flat Numix Remix

Version 4.3.4
Date  01/07/2016

This icon set is based on four different icon themes I like.

-Ultra Flat icons

-Super Flat remix icons

-Yltra Flat icons

-Numix (Circle) icons


On top of that many icons have been changed and added to my personal preference.



Individual folder colours have been added :

- light blue

- arch blue

- orange

- grey-orange


#Why this icon set


I wanted to try out the hierarchical structure of the folders that Numix uses and see what the advantages are.

A structure change from actions/scalable to 16x16/actions. A lot of work. Now let us discover the advantages.


I started to work on the basis of an another icon theme I made i.e. Yltra Flat icon set also on this github.

# How is it managed

To be able to manage this icon set <b>Super Ultra Flat Numix Remix</b> is the main icon set. All the others inherit icons from <b>Super Ultra Flat Numix Remix</b>. 

Other icon sets will have different folder colours but all other icons come from the main one.

If you fix an app icon, it will be fixed for all icon sets.

In this manner we are saving also many megabytes and double work (which I hate).

Numix is providing the folder for actions, animations and status. All the rest is from the other icon sets.
