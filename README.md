# Super Ultra Flat Numix Remix

Version 4.0

This icon set is based on four different icon theme I like.

-Ultra Flat icons

-Super Flat remix icons

-Yltra Flat icons

-Numix (Circle) icons


On top of that many icons have been changed and added to my personal preference.



Individual folder colours have been added :

- light blue

- arch blue

- orange

- grey-orange


I wanted to try out the hierarchical structure of folders that Numix uses and see what the advantages are.

16x16/actions ...  instead of actions/scalable. In the first case you can fix your icons to be 16 pixels and not a pixel more.


I worked on the bases of another icon theme that is on this github Yltra Flat icon set.

# How is it managed

To be able to manage this icon set <b>Super Ultra Flat Numix Remix</b> is the main icon set. All the others inherit icons from <b>Super Ultra Flat Numix Remix</b>. 

Other icon sets will have different folder colours but all other icons come from the main one.

If you fix an app icon, it will be fixed for all icon sets.

In this manner we are saving also many megabytes and double work (which I hate).

Numix is providing the folder for actions, animations and status. All the rest is from the other icon sets.
